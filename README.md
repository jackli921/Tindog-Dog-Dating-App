## Tindog
A dating app for dogs built using Vanilla JavaScript


## Overview 
Tindog began as a simple solo project for consolidating array methods taught in **Module 7 - Next Level JavaScript** [Scrimba Frontend Career Path Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). To improve the user experience, I imposed lots of stretch goals to create a more complete browsing experience.

## Features
1. 10+ complete dog profiles from around the world.
2. Welcoming landing page with user consent button  
3. App walk-through with animated written instructions
4. Like, reject, superlike, and rewind functions
5. Collapsible information panel that reveals additional information about the dog 

## Installation
Tindog is a standalone web app that does not require any installation. 

To run the project locally: 
1. Clone the project locally
2. Install "Live Server" if using VSCode
3. Right click "index.html" for "**Show Preview**" or "**Run locally**"

Alternatively, you can:  
1. Open the project folder in your code editor
2. Right click "index.html" for "**Copy Path**"
3. Paste the path into your browser and hit enter
